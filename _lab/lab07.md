In this lab, you'll get more practice with:

* Testing your functions with pytest
* Using String Formatting
* Reading and processing files

## This lab should be done solo.

# Instructions

In this lab, you will need to create two files:
* `{{page.num}}.py` - file containing function definitions
* `{{page.num}}_tests.py` - file containing test cases
* <strong>Please comment your name / perm at the top of each file.</strong>
* <strong>Make sure to have a docstring for every function.</strong>

Starter code is provided for you at the bottom of this page.

1.  Create a directory called `~/cs8/{{page.num}}` (using the `mkdir` command) and `cd` into that directory.
2.  Use `idle3` (you might try `idle3 &` if you want to be able to type commands on your terminal window after IDLE opens).
3.  Use "New File" to create empty files called `{{page.num}}.py` and `{{page.num}}_tests.py` in that `~/cs8/{{page.num}}` directory.


# Some notes about the File I/O functions

Create two files `input1.txt` and `input2.txt` in the `~/cs8/{{page.num}}` directory. Use these two input files to test your functionality: add a small number of words (2-10) first to make sure that you can verify that your function is working correctly. Add punctuation next to make sure you can correctly remove it; test for contractions, e.g., "don't".

These files are used when running pytest on `{{page.num}}_tests.py`. We will be using additional input files to test your submission on Gradescope.

Note that all words are separated by a whitespace character, and a word contains only alpha-numeric characters that does not include punctuation characters. For simplicity, you may assume the text only contains the `,.!?;` punctuation characters. Your code will need to split and strip the text file string appropriately.


# Notes on computing the most common words

If you run `mostCommonWords("input1.txt", 1)`, this function should essentially return the mode value from the file (the word that occurs most often). To be able to return **the list** of most common words, you will need to count how many times each word occurred in a file. Implement `wordFrequency` to help you first count the words in a file, then `mostCommonWords()` can sort them by the frequencies and store `N` of them into the returned list.

* Test your function by making sure your input file has something like "hello hello hello world" and that you are able to return "hello" as the most frequently occuring word. 
* Test your function by making sure if your "input1.txt" has something like "hello hello hello world" and you call `mostCommonWords("input1.txt", 2)`, the function correctly returns `['hello', 'world']`.
* Test your function by making sure if your "input2.txt" has something like "hello world world world" and you call `mostCommonWords("input2.txt", 2)`, the function correctly returns `['world', 'hello']`.
* Test your function by making sure if your "input2.txt" has something like "hello world world world" and you call `mostCommonWords("input2.txt", 3)`, the function correctly prints `[Error] The "input2.txt" contains 2 unique words.`. Check that it also returns `None`.



# Upload `{{page.num}}.py` and `{{page.num}}_tests.py` to Gradescope.

Once you're done with writing your functions, navigate to the Lab assignment "Lab06" on Gradescope and upload your `{{page.num}}.py` and `{{page.num}}_tests.py` files.


# `{{page.num}}.py`

```python
# lab07.py

# Student: (insert name and perm number here)


def totalWords(filename):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file from filename in your function and returns
    the number of words in the file.
    - Words are separated by whitespace characters, but the count doesn't include
    the following punctuation characters (,.!?;). You can assume contractions
    count as one word (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - The split and strip functions may be useful in your implementation.
    - Your function should open the file for reading, and close
    the file before returning.
    '''
    return "stub"


def longestWord(filename):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file from filename in your function and returns
    the longest word in the text file.
    - Words are separated by whitespace characters, but do not include
    the following punctuation characters (,.!?;). You can assume contractions
    count as one word (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - In the case of a tie, the 1st occurrence of the longest word
    is returned.
    - The split and strip functions may be useful.
    - Your function should open the file for reading, and close
    the file before returning.
    '''
    return "stub"


def charactersPerWord(filename):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file with filename into your function and returns
    the average number of characters per word.
    - Words are separated by whitespace characters, but does not include
    the following punctuation characters (,.!?;). You can assume contractions
    count as one word (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - The split and strip functions may be useful.
    - Your function should open the file for reading, and close
    the file when done.
    '''
    return "stub"


def wordFrequency(filename):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file from filename in your function and returns a dictionary 
    with the frequency of each word as its value.
    - Words are separated by whitespace characters, but do not include
    the following punctuation characters (,.!?;). You can assume contractions
    count as one word (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - The split and strip functions may be useful.
    - You can assume contractions count as one word 
    (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - Your function should open the file for reading, and close
    the file before returning.
    '''
    return "stub"
    
    
def mostCommonWords(filename, N):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file from filename in your function and returns a list of N most
    common words in the text file (i.e., N words with the highest frequency),
    sorted by the number of times they occured in the file (most common first).
    - Use wordFrequency() helper function to count the frequency of each word.
    - Print "[Error] The "<filename>" contains <X> unique words." and return None
    if N is larger than the number of words in the file (substitute "<filename>"
    and <X> with the actual values).
    '''
    return "stub"
