In this lab, you'll get more practice with:

* Using `randrange`
* Testing your functions with pytest
* Using String Formatting
* Reading and processing files

## This lab should be done solo.

# Instructions

In this lab, you will need to create two files:
* `{{page.num}}.py` - file containing function definitions
* `{{page.num}}_tests.py` - file containing test cases
* <strong>Please comment your name / perm at the top of each file.</strong>
* <strong>Make sure to have a docstring for every function.</strong>

Starter code is provided for you at the bottom of this page.

1.  Create a directory called `~/cs8/{{page.num}}` (using the `mkdir` command) and `cd` into that directory.
2.  Use `idle3` (you might try `idle3 &` if you want to be able to type commands on your terminal window after IDLE opens).
3.  Use "New File" to create empty files called `{{page.num}}.py` and `{{page.num}}_tests.py` in that `~/cs8/{{page.num}}` directory.
4.  Create two files `input1.txt` and `input2.txt` in the `~/cs8/{{page.num}}` directory. Add a small number of words (2-10) first to make sure that you can verify that your function is working correctly. These files are used when running pytest on {{page.num}}_tests.py.


# Some notes about printing the dice distribution

An example `printDistribution` function will appear as follows:

```
Distribution of dice rolls

 2:     7 (  2.8%)  *******
 3:    14 (  5.6%)  **************
 4:    29 ( 11.6%)  *****************************
 5:    26 ( 10.4%)  **************************
 6:    34 ( 13.6%)  **********************************
 7:    41 ( 16.4%)  *****************************************
 8:    30 ( 12.0%)  ******************************
 9:    23 (  9.2%)  ***********************
10:    23 (  9.2%)  ***********************
11:    16 (  6.4%)  ****************
12:     7 (  2.8%)  *******
------------------------------
250 rolls
```

**Note that your formatting should be exact to pass the tests on Gradescope.**

* The first line is simply "`Distribution of dice rolls`" followed by an empty line.
* The dice rolls are printed in a histogram format, one for each roll with additional information.
	* Your solution should print this portion while iterating through the `diceTally` in a loop using the `.format` function. <strong>Do not simply write 11 print statements using `.format`.</strong> 
	* The dice roll values will have two spaces right-justified followed by a `':'` character.
	* Six spaces are reserved to print number of times a particular roll occurred, which is right-justified, followed by an empty space and open parenthesis, `'('`, characters.
	* 5 spaces are reserved for the actual percentage value, with one space for the floating point value. This is followed by the `'%)'`, and two blank spaces.
	* The `'*'` character is printed the number of times a particular dice roll occurred.
* 30 hyphens `-` are printed after the `diceRolls` are printed (_hint: use string manipulation using `*` to help you._)
* The number of rolls is then printed.
* Using your function definitions, the following statement should display an output similar (but not exactly since `rollDice` is random) to the output shown above:

```>>> printDistribution(rollDistribution(250))```

# Some notes about the File I/O functions

Create two input files to test your functionality. We will be using additional input files to test your submission on Gradescope.

Note that all words are separated by a whitespace character, and a word contains only alpha-numeric characters that does not include punctuation characters. For simplicity, you may assume the text only contains the `,.!?;` punctuation characters. Your code will need to split and strip the text file string appropriately.

# Upload `{{page.num}}.py` and `{{page.num}}_tests.py` to Gradescope.

Once you're done with writing your functions, navigate to the Lab assignment "Lab06" on Gradescope and upload your `{{page.num}}.py` and `{{page.num}}_tests.py` files.


# `{{page.num}}.py`

```python
# lab06.py

# Student: (insert name and perm number here)

from random import randrange

def rollDice():
    '''
    (10 points)
    Function that returns the sum of rolling two six-sided dice.
    - Note that the possible sum of rolling two dice is [2-12].
    However, this distribution is not uniform (i.e. rolling a 2 does
    not have the same probability as rolling a 6). Your function must
    use randrange correctly to account for this.
    '''
    return "stub"


def rollDistribution(n):
    '''
    (10 points)
    Function that rolls a pair of dice n number of times. Returns a
    list of ints, diceTally, that keeps track of the number of times
    a certain sum occurs.
    - Use the technique discussed in lecture where you can create a
    list of 13 integers, where the index of the list represents a
    particular dice roll value, and the value of that position represents
    the number of times that dice roll occurred.
    - Note: diceTally[0] and diceTally[1] will always be 0 since
    having rolling a pair of dice will never result in 0 or 1.
    - Your algorithm should call rollDice() n number of times when
    populating your list.
    '''
    return "stub"


def printDistribution(diceTally):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Function that prints the diceTally distribution in a specific
    format (see lab instructions for more details).
    - This function does not return anything since it is simply
    printing to the console.
    - Note: Your algorithm must iterate and print each dice roll value in
    a loop. Do not simply have 11 print statements for each dice roll value.
    - Be VERY PRECISE in your format. Each character matters for full credit.
    '''
    return


def totalWords(filename):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file from filename in your function and returns
    the number of words in the file.
    - Words are separated by whitespace characters, but the count doesn't include
    the following punctuation characters (,.!?;). You can assume contractions
    count as one word (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - The split and strip functions may be useful in your implementation.
    - Your function should open the file for reading, and close
    the file before returning.
    '''
    return "stub"


def longestWord(filename):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file from filename in your function and returns
    the longest word in the text file.
    - Words are separated by whitespace characters, but do not include
    the following punctuation characters (,.!?;). You can assume contractions
    count as one word (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - In the case of a tie, the 1st occurrence of the longest word
    is returned.
    - The split and strip functions may be useful.
    - Your function should open the file for reading, and close
    the file before returning.
    '''
    return "stub"


def charactersPerWord(filename):
    '''
    (20 points)
    Reads the file with filename into your function and returns
    the average number of characters per word.
    - Words are separated by whitespace characters, but does not include
    the following punctuation characters (,.!?;). You can assume contractions
    count as one word (i.e. "don't", "you'll", etc. are one word).
    - The split and strip functions may be useful.
    - Your function should open the file for reading, and close
    the file when done.
    '''
    return "stub"
