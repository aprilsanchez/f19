The goals for this lab are:

* perform a Monte Carlo coin flip experiment
* use Python's `random` module 
* simulate a random walk
* explore what happens when we add several random numbers together
* use `plotHistogram` function
* see an illustration of the Central Limit Theorem

## This lab should be done solo. 

Make sure that you adhere to the [Academic Integrity](https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity) standards and do/submit your own work.

**You are allowed to use only the materials that we discussed in class and that are in our textbook. Using code that we have not covered constitutes a violation of academic integrity.**


## A brief introduction to Monte Carlo Method

In short, the *Monte Carlo Method*, or a *Monte Carlo Experiment* is to repeat random samplings in order to get numerical results. We adopt this method in order to look behind the randomness and figure out something deterministic from it. For example, we can repeat a random experiment (e.g., flip a coin) for many times and count the numbers for each result (e.g., head or tail of the coin), in order to estimate the **probability** of each result happening (e.g., the number of heads or tails is usually about half of total flips). For more information, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).



## Getting started

## Step 1: Log on and open up a terminal window

This is done following the steps you have performed in lab00.

## Step 2: Create a directory in your cs8 directory named {{page.num}}.

This is done by following the sequence of steps in the first lab (lab00).

## Step 3: Start IDLE. 

The terminal command for this is `idle3`, or `idle3 &` if you want to be able to type commands on your terminal window after IDLE opens.  When you have the IDLE window up, you are ready for some programming!

## Step 4: Download `cTurtle.py` and `hist.py` files

For this lab, you will need to have the `hist` module [hist.py](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~buoni/cs8/hist.py), and `cTurtle` module [cTurtle.py](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~buoni/cs8/cTurtle.py) in your home directory or in some other directory in your Python path.


## What to program?
<u>Note: Unless otherwise stated please write your functions with the exact same name and parameter list as what is specified. </u>

# Functions to Implement:

## Basic:
1. `coinFlipExperiment(M, N, nTrials)` - returns a probability (a value between 0 and 1)
2. `monteCarloRandomWalkFirstPassage(D, nTrials)` - return a list [average_steps, list_of_steps], and plot a histogram of steps
3. `plotRandomUniformSum(M, N, nBins)` - plot a histogram , and return a list

### Function Details:

## 1. `coinFlipExperiment(M, N, nTrials)`

Write a function that estimates the probability of getting `M` or more heads out of `N` fair coin flips (by fair we mean the coin has an equal chance of turning up heads or tails), repeating this sequence of flips a total of ` nTrials` times. 

To perform this experiment, you should define a helper function `coinFlipTrial(M, N)` that performs one sequence of `N` coin flips and returns `True` if the number of heads is greater than or equal to `M`, and `False` otherwise.  A test you can use for your functions is to estimate the probability of getting 8 or more heads out of 10 coin flips, which should be around 5 percent (0.05).

_Hint_: You can use `random.randint` values to represent coin sides or you can use it to index an array that holds the values representing a coin.

## 2. `monteCarloRandomWalkFirstPassage(D, nTrials)` 

Consider a random walk in two dimensions.  A walker starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and takes steps each of unit length and each in a completely random direction until reaching a distance `D` or further away from the origin.  Write a function `monteCarloRandomWalkFirstPassage` that performs `nTrials` of such an experiment, return a list `[average_steps, list_of_steps]`, where the `average_steps` means the average number of steps required to first reach a distance `D` or more from the origin, and the `list_of_steps` is a list of `nTrials` numbers, recording the number of steps for each trial. Also, plots a histogram of the distribution of number of steps required. 

Before you begin, take a look at the following video -- the first minute of it can help you visualize this simulation:
[A Random Walk & Monte Carlo Simulation || Python Tutorial by Socratica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfS2H1y6tzQ)
(note that their solution is not applicable to the problem you are solving here, hence, you shouldn't be using it; see also the note about the academic integrity at the start of this lab).

You will want to write a helper function `randomWalkFirstPassageTrial(D)` that returns the number of steps required to reach a distance `D` or more away for one trial of such an experiment.  One random walk trial consists of a walker starting at the origin `(0,0)` taking unit steps in the `theta = random.uniform(0, 2*math.pi)` direction.  The change in `x` and `y` (the size of the step) are `math.cos(theta)` and `math.sin(theta)`, respectively.  At any point in the walk, the distance is given by `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. 

You will want to use the `plotHistogram(myList, binMin, binMax, nBins, title)` function from [hist.py](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~buoni/cs8/hist.py). This function will help you plot a [histogram]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram). Again, remember to download the `hist.py` module and the `cTurtle.py` module **in your working directory first.** In this function, 

* `myList` means a list of values that you would like to plot into a histogram; 

* `binMin` means the minimal (left) boundary of the histogram. For those elements in `myList` that are less than `binMin`, they will be put into the first bin. If `binMin` is a boolean value, then the minimal boundary will be the minimal element in `myList`. `binMin` is defaulted as `False`. 

* `binMax` means the maximal (right) boundary of the histogram. For those elements in `myList` that are greater than `binMax`, they will be put into the last bin. If `binMax` is a boolean value, then the maximal boundary will be the maximal element in `myList`. `binMax` is defaulted as `False`. 

* `nBins` means the number of bins in the histogram. `nBins` is defaulted as 20.

* `title` is the title of the histogram. `title` is defaulted as `''`.

First, define a list of random numbers `randomList`, and then test the function `plotHistogram`. Here are some examples:

```Python
import random
import hist
randomList = [] # make an empty list
for i in range(0,100):
	random_item = random.uniform(1,10) # get a random number from 1-10 uniform distribution
	randomList.append(random_item) # append the random number to the list.

# Test each of the following calls, and see what happens and what are the differences.
# hist.plotHistogram(randomList)
# hist.plotHistogram(randomList, False, False, 20)
# hist.plotHistogram(randomList, False, False, 10)
# hist.plotHistogram(randomList, False, False, 10, 'testHistogram')
# hist.plotHistogram(randomList, 2, 9, 20)
# hist.plotHistogram(randomList, 5, 6, 6, 'partial Histogram')
#You can also write down your own calls:
# hist.plotHistogram(...)
```

**Remember** that `return` means to exit the function. Therefore, you should first plot the histogram and then return the list.

Below is the histogram of distances for D=10, and nTrials = 10000 using nBins = 20.

## 3. `plotRandomUniformSum(M, N, nBins)` 

Let's consider what happens when we add `M` uniform random numbers together.  Since each random number can be between `0` and `1`, we expect this sum will be between `0` and `M`, but somehow we expect that it is more likely for the sum to be near the middle (`M/2`) than near the ends (`0` and `M`) for M > 1.  First write a function `randomUniformSum(M)` that adds up `M` uniform random numbers between `0` and `1`.  Second, write a function that forms a **list** of `N` such numbers by calling `randomUniformSum` a total of `N` times. Third, plot the result in a histogram and return the **list**.

**Remember** that `return` means to exit the function. Therefore, you should first plot the histogram and then return the list.

What values should you use for `binMin` and `binMax`?  To answer this, consider the minimum and maximum values that `randomUniformSum` may assume.   Try calling your function four times with `M = 1, 2, 3, 10` setting `N = 1000000` and `nBins = 100` in each case.  You will notice that as `M` increases, the distribution looks more and more like a Normal (or Gaussian) distribution.  This is an illustration of the Central Limit Theorem, a very important theorem from Statistics which states that as you add more and more independent random variables (from any distribution, doesn't have to be uniform) the sum approaches a Normal distribution - very cool :-).

## Advanced (if you are curious and time permits):

**A1**. Generalize your `coinFlipExperiment` function to include one extra parameter, `p`, the probability that a coin flip results in heads, thus allowing for a "weighted" coin. After generalization, the function should be `coinFlipExperiment(M, N, nTrials, p)`.

**A2**. Improve the efficiency of your helper function `coinFlipTrial` so that the function returns `True` as soon as `M` flips resulting in heads is achieved, or `False` as soon as it is impossible to achieve `M` heads. Here you **DO NOT** need to include the probability parameter we've just mentioned in A1. After generalization, the function should still be `coinFlipTrial(M, N)`.
